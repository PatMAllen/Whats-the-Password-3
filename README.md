In this Challenge It took a bit of research and reviewing to correctly structure the JS Script for this assignment.

WHEN I click the button to generate a password

-In the js script it will show the functions and variables needed to genetrate the password! Along with the structure of the script to ensure the proper execution of the page!

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

-There will be a set of passord criteria questions created in the prompt before generation of the password itself!


THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

-These will be provided in the Prompt section of the JS script!

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

-You will be prompted to enter the amount of characters you want within your own password!

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

-All questions within the Prompt portion of the JS script will provide these questions!

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

-The selection was made to be randomnized with the option to limit the amount of characters to help limit confusion!
